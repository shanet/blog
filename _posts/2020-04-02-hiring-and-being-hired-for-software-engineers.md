title: "Hiring and Being Hired: For Software Engineers"

Over the past five years I have conducted 750+ interviews and directly reviewed 10,000+ more. Through that I made observations with the hiring process, common candidate pitfalls, and possible improvements and optimizations we can make to our hiring processes.

The result is a series all about hiring and being hired for software engineering positions. The perspective from both sides of the table is analyzed: how can we as hiring managers improve our processes to more accurately assess candidates in order to build the best team possible? Likewise, how can we as candidates navigate the minefield of technical interviews to come out on top with the limited visibility we have into the process we find ourselves in?
