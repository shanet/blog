If you don't know about <a title="Best text editor ever." href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> you should click on that link right now. Sublime is by far my favorite GUI text editor (I still love you vi and nano), but when doing Android development it's impossible to beat the convenience that the Android plugin for Eclipse provides. However, the default color scheme is Eclipse is nothing like that of Sublime's. Thus, here's how to get the Sublime color scheme (and a lot more) in Eclipse.

First, install the <a href="http://www.eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=plugin">Eclipse Color Scheme Plugin</a>. Then, in Eclipse, go <em>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; General &gt; Appearance &gt; Color Theme </em>and select the Sublime Text color scheme. If it isn't already there, you can download it from the <a href="http://www.eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&amp;id=66">Eclipse Color Themes' website</a>.

And that's it! Simple.
