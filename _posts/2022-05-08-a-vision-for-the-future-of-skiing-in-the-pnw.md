title: A vision for the future of skiing in the PNW
date: 2022-05-08
---

Here we are at the end of the 2021/2022 ski season. On trend with the previous two years, it was another challenging season. This post is the last in a series about the future of skiing and winter recreation in the PNW and how we can potentially go about addressing the challenges that we face. Previously I explored [what prevented expansion of our ski areas]({% post_url 2022-05-04-the-politics-of-ski-areas-what-prevents-ski-area-expansion-in-the-pnw %}) and [how the Cascades snowpack is responding to climate change]({% post_url 2022-04-12-when-is-the-end-of-the-golden-age-of-pnw-skiing %}). This post seeks to find solutions to the following problems currently affecting skiing in the PNW:

1. Washington's rapidly growing population causing overcrowding at existing ski areas
1. Corporate consolidation leading to ski area owners not having the sport's best short or long term interests in mind
1. Climate change causing existing areas to become nonviable in the foreseeable future
1. The lack of potential expansion locations due to land use restrictions

After I published my previous post on what prevents ski area expansion I had conversations with a handful of people involved in other aspects of mountain recreation. This opened my eyes to how the land restrictions in the Cascades affect not only winter recreation but also summer recreation more than I had previously considered. Much of the topics discussed here apply to summer recreation as well. It may be worth to explore those topics further but this post sticks purely to skiing as it's the topic I know best and would set the stage for increased summer access as well.

## Why do we need expanded skiing &amp; winter recreation capacity?

Anyone that has tried to go to Stevens Pass, Crystal Mountain, or Snoqualmie Pass on a mid-winter weekend in the past few years is well aware of how crowded they are, even on a normal weekend let alone a powder day. It is great that there is so much interest in skiing and winter sports, but our ski areas have not kept up with population growth. While Washington's population has increased from 4.9M in 1990 to 7.6M in 2022 only modest ski area expansions have taken place during that same time period. Consider the 1990 trail maps from our local ski areas below:

[![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/crystal_mountain_1990.jpg){: .thumbnail}](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/crystal_mountain_1990.jpg)

[![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/stevens_pass_1990.jpg){: .thumbnail}](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/stevens_pass_1990.jpg)
[![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/mt_baker_1990.jpg){: .thumbnail}](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/mt_baker_1990.jpg)
[![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/mission_ridge_1990.jpg){: .thumbnail}](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/mission_ridge_1990.jpg)
[![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/white_pass_1990.jpg){: .thumbnail}](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/white_pass_1990.jpg)

The only notable terrain expansions have been the addition of the Northway chair at Crystal and White Pass's Paradise Basin expansion. All additional capacity since then has come from chairlift upgrades to increase uphill capacity through larger chairs and/or high speed, detachable chairlifts (and the gondola at Crystal). For some of those maps it's interesting to see that the parking lots are almost entirely unchanged since 1990 as well.

This lack of investment worked for a while but in the past few years it has really started to bite. In early 2020, in response to overwhelming demand Crystal stopped selling walk-up day tickets.<sup>[1]</sup> In 2022, Crystal implemented a parking reservation system in at attempt to better control its parking lots.<sup>[2]</sup> Stevens has similar problems. On any given weekend the parking lots at the base area will be full and the overflow lots further down the highway at Yodelin and the Nordic Center will be in use. On some weekends even those fill to capacity and anyone that shows up is turned away entirely. Efforts are being made to encourage carpooling and the use of shuttles/buses to get people to the mountain but does not address the lift or terrain capacity issues.

This is not a problem unique to Washington. As anyone in Colorado or Utah, for instance, will tell you getting to a chairlift on a winter weekend can be a challenging endeavor. However, Washington is unique in that for the Western Washington population there are effectively only seven reliable snow access points. Even if you are not a skier, you have to contend with the crowds to enjoy any type of winter recreation. This includes snowshoers or families that want go sledding with their children (Paradise being the only not overcrowded option for these activities).

![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/snow_access_points.png)<br>

The conclusion is that our ski areas and snow access points in general are vastly overcapacity. With more population growth in the future, we need to consider solutions to meet or at least try to keep up with demand.

## Lost ski areas

In addition to the modest ski area expansions that have taken place in recent decades, there has also been wholesale losses of ski areas over the years. Two of which are notable in Western Washington: Yodelin and Mt. Pilchuck.

### Yodelin

Yodelin sat just 1.5mi down the road from Stevens Pass and operated from 1969 - 1974. Unlike most ski areas in Washington it was planned with residential housing in mind. Plans called for four chairlifts in addition to a cable car to Lichtenburg mountain on the north side of the highway. Unfortunately, a negligent developer of these residential sites ignored avalanche warnings and in 1971 an avalanche killed four people in two cabins. The ski area, on the other side of the highway, continued to operate, even adding a second chairlift the following year. However, by 1974 it had closed taking with it the possibility of expanded skiing along US-2. Today Yodelin is a popular beginner ski touring location as its ski runs are still well defined and visible if you know where to look from the chairlifts at Stevens. In addition, its parking lot continues to be used as an overflow lot for Stevens on busy days. The residential cabins on the north side of the highway remain as well.<sup>[3]</sup>

### Mt. Pilchuck

The Mt. Pilchuck ski area, located outside of Granite Falls, operated from 1956 to 1977. Pilchuck is notable for being located so on the far western ski of the Cascades while still having a summit elevation of 5,344ft. This means it's only a 45 minute drive from Everett. [In my previous post]({% post_url 2022-05-04-the-politics-of-ski-areas-what-prevents-ski-area-expansion-in-the-pnw %}) I touched on how red tape between the forest service and Washington's park service forced the ski area to close. Pilchuck wanted to expand its terrain further and higher up the mountain which would have been important to access the more consistent snow at that elevation. Between the permitting issues and the poor snow year in 1977 it too closed eliminating another ski area for Western Washington's growing population.

This is all to say that here in 2022 we are arguably in a worse position than we were in the 1970s when it comes to ski areas in Western Washington. While our ski areas are undoubtedly larger and have higher capacity than they did in the 1970s there are fewer of them meaning less competition in the market and less incentive to attract skiers to their mountains.

## Corporate Consolidation

It is no secret that in the past \~20 years the ski industry has undergone a tremendous amount of consolidation. Namely, by four companies: Vail, Alterra, Boyne Resorts, and POWDR Corporation. The ski areas near Seattle are all owned by one of these companies:

* Stevens Pass: Vail
* Crystal Mountain: Alterra
* The Summit at Snoqualmie: Boyne Resorts

Fortunately, we do have some still independent mountains: Mt. Baker, Mission Ridge, and White Pass. These are all smaller than the corporation owned mountains and are lengthy drives from the major population center of Seattle making them more suited to serving their local communities.

There is much to be said on the ethics around [treatment of employees](https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/snow-sports/stevens-pass-park-city-ski-patrollers-picketing-vail-resorts/) of some of these companies. Nearly all skiers around Seattle know all too well about the issues that have plagued Stevens Pass since the 2018 Vail acquisition. [Much has been said about these issues](https://www.seattletimes.com/life/outdoors/closed-terrain-staff-shortages-plague-stevens-pass-at-start-of-washingtons-2021-22-ski-season/) so I will not cover them here. The operational issues run deep and it remains to be seen if the attempts to address them will result in any meaningful changes.

Aside from short term [operational issues](https://www.instagram.com/p/CaN3E_Nv6Oh/), the longer term danger I believe these ski corporations represent is that they are not ski companies but rather marketing &amp; real estate &amp; companies. Let's consider Vail for example. Vail's business model operates around a few key points:

* Market towards the top 3% of household income.<sup>[4]</sup> Anyone in the middle class does not matter to them.
  ![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/vail_target_customers.png)
* Sell as many Epic passes as possible to create a stable and predictable revenue stream to hedge against poor snow conditions in a given year.<sup>[5]</sup>
  * Part of the reason why day tickets are so expensive is because Vail does not want that revenue. They want all of their customers to be on what they call a "subscription tier" similar to a video streaming service. The day ticket prices are so expensive specifically to turn away anyone that has not bought into the Epic Pass ecosystem. Vail tells their investors they want 75% of revenue to come from advance sales specifically.
  ![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/vail_revenue_channels.png)
* Leverage network effects to keep skiers within their network all season long.
  * This requires the acquisition of smaller, local mountains to drive traffic to their destination, high margin mountains.

The creation of these network passes combined with the lock-in effects of the networks and the near impossibility for new competing ski areas to open has removed any incentive for Vail and crowd to provide a quality mountain experience. Their revenue is driven directly by how many passes they sell and how many people they can get on-site at their premiere, destination mountains. Your local mountain that was bought by Vail only serves as part of a pipeline to upsell you to their other more expensive properties. There is no incentive to upgrade or improve these local ski areas beyond the bare minimum required to keep them operating since they already have your money before the season starts.

In fact, the inability for new ski areas to open is viewed as a positive by Vail.<sup>[5]</sup> They tell their investors the lack of new ski areas forces the market into their existing properties. The more of these they acquire, the stronger that lock-in effect becomes with no way to reduce it since it's effectively impossible for new players to enter the market. By not allowing new ski areas to open we are playing right into the corporate hands of the ski corporations by giving them a oligopoly allowing them to extract ever higher profits. 

![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/vail_market_forces.png)

When it comes to Western Washington, the lack of inventive to upgrade and expand ski areas means that the only way to deal with the demand for skiing is to raise prices even further. This results in more and more people being priced out of the sport. Winter sports have never been cheap with high up-front costs for gear and ongoing transportation costs to get to the mountain. Thanks to lift ticket prices it is becoming dramatically more unattainable to anyone in the middle class.

Ask yourself, what is the future of this sport when a day ticket, gear rental, and lesson for one person is over $500? Then multiply that by four for a family with two children. This is the real danger the corporate consolidation and their greed presents in my opinion; that we are at the start of pricing out a future generation of snow sports. What does skiing look like 20 years from now when that generation grows up and their interests lie elsewhere?

## Climate Change

Now, none of this matters anyway if climate change is going to affect the snowpack in the Cascades to the point that we don't have skiing here at all anymore. Fortunately, this likely is not going to be case. [I previously did a deep analysis into snowpack trends in the Cascades]({% post_url 2022-04-12-when-is-the-end-of-the-golden-age-of-pnw-skiing %}) with data stretching back over 100 years and analyzing peer reviewed studies on the Cascades snowpack. The final takeaway from this analysis being:

> The Cascades have experienced a \~20% decline of snowpack from 1930 - 2022 at a rate of 2% per decade. However, this is primarily limited to low elevations below 4,000ft and is due to increased temperatures rather than decreased precipitation. At high elevations (>4,000ft) the snowpack has not seen these large declines for now but increasing global temperatures and natural variability will begin to, potentially rapidly, affect these elevations in the coming decades.

As a small sample of this analysis, our snowpack at the higher elevations used for skiing (>4,000ft) is stable. Consider the snowdepth per year at Paradise (5,425ft):

  <div class="description"></div>
</div>

Moreover, the length of our ski seasons show no statistically significant decline either. The daily snowdepth at Paradise:

There is a big caveat to this, however. Year to year natural variability as well as decades long variability have a significant affect on our climate. This variability combined with ever increasing global temperatures means our lower elevation ski areas more and more at risk each year. As such, any future ski areas should prioritize higher elevations above all else for them to remain economically viable as the world (hopefully) transitions to carbon free/neutral forms of energy. But even with +2&deg;C of warming the high elevation locations in the Cascades will still have sufficient snowfall for skiing. Beyond +2&deg;C however and, well, we're going to have bigger problems to worry about than where to find some fresh snow.

The other looming issue is Snoqualmie Pass. It is the lowest elevation ski area in Western Washington at \~3,000ft. As I explored in [my snowpack analysis post](({% post_url 2022-04-12-when-is-the-end-of-the-golden-age-of-pnw-skiing %})) Snoqualmie is already seeing snowpack declines unlike other ski areas in the Cascades. Given how much of the Seattle population it serves we should be thinking about if/where its capacity will be moved to. By 2050 it's likely there will be insufficient snowpack for skiing there.<sup>[6]</sup> The economic viability of the ski area will likely founder well before then, potentially as soon as the 2030s. As this happens it will create even more stress on the higher elevation ski areas as displaced skiers migrate to new mountains. Given how long it takes ski area expansions to come to fruition (decades) we need to start planning for this now.

## Mountains of Red Tape (todo: change the title here to something wilderness area related)

One of the major challenges of expanding skiing in the Cascades is finding a location to do so. There are nearly zero locations of sufficient elevation that are not in protected wilderness or roadless areas. I explored the problem of land restrictions deeply in my previous post on [the politics of ski areas]({% post_url 2022-05-04-the-politics-of-ski-areas-what-prevents-ski-area-expansion-in-the-pnw %}) and why it's so difficult to get more access for winter recreation. In short, vast amount of land in the Cascades are designated as wilderness areas as defined by the 1964 Wilderness Act and subsequent 1984 Washington State Wilderness Act. For those unfamiliar with the concept of wilderness areas, a wilderness area is land designated by Congress that may not be developed or have any mechanized use on under any circumstances (with very limited exceptions). Short of an act of Congress, they are closed to development permanently.

Wilderness areas are wonderful for preservation and recreation for avid outdoorsmen. We are fortunate in Washington to have so much of our mountains protected by them. However, they do pose a challenge for winter sports. This is because nearly all of the high elevation land in the western Cascades that would be suitable for skiing is wilderness. In some existing ski areas, such as Stevens Pass and Crystal Mountain, it is possible to expand them without encroaching on wilderness land, but in others, such as Mt. Baker, it is not. And if a new ski area were to ever be developed it would be exceedingly difficult to do it purely on unprotected forest service land.

While locations for additional ski terrain that don't require wilderness area changes should be prioritized and preferred, in [my previous post]({% post_url 2022-05-04-the-politics-of-ski-areas-what-prevents-ski-area-expansion-in-the-pnw %}) I concluded that it is likely inevitable that some ski area expansion would realistically need to take place on wilderness area land.

todo: hit on size of this proposal more

It's worth too keeping in mind the scale of this type of proposal to reclassify wilderness areas. Washington has 4,351,872 total acres of wilderness areas<sup>[7]</sup>. Let's say we were to double the size of the six ski areas in the Washington Cascades, at roughly 800 acres for each that would be 0.1% of wilderness land. In reality, that number would be lower since not all expansion land needs to come from wilderness areas and it would not be necessary to double everything in size.

todo: include seattle times article about ski industry in danger

However, this could be done such that:

1. Any wilderness land removed is swapped with the same or more amount of land elsewhere to ensure that the overall amount of wilderness land remain the same or increases overall.
1. Former wilderness land could be re-designated as a National Recreation Area ensuring that it remain used purely for recreational purposes and never for commercial resource extraction such as logging.
1. Only minimally necessary development is performed.
  * There is a reason that I use the term "ski area" in my writing here instead of "ski resort." All of Washington's ski areas are currently day use locations (except Crystal which is starting to deviate from this). When the lifts stop for the day everyone goes home. There are no hotels, condo complexes, restaurants, shopping, etc. There is nothing "resort" like about Washington's ski areas. They are minimal, simple and that's just the way we like them.
  * Massive Colorado-style resort developments that are glorified real estate sales should have no place in the Cascades. Which, since there is little private land in the Cascades, certainly not enough to build a large resort development, there's not much risk of this happening anyway.
    ![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/vail_co.jpg)
    <sub>We don't need this in our mountains.</sub>

There actually is precedent for this. In 1984 as part of the Washington State Wilderness Act some 800 acres of the Goat Rocks wilderness area were removed specifically to allow White Pass to expand. This land became the Hogback/Paradise Basin expansion and effectively doubled the size of White Pass allowing for a much needed capacity increase. Representative Sid Morrison at the time wrote in regards to this provision in the bill "an expanded White Pass area was truly the highest and best public use for that portion of the Goat Rocks."<sup>[8]</sup> This is indeed the metric we should be operating with, the highest and best public use. Plus, it helped that while the bill removed 800 acres from Goat Rocks, it added another 23,000 acres.

![](/assets/images/ski_area_study/white_pass_wilderness_adjustment.png)

But this is public land. As a skier I am obviously somewhat biased in my assessment. This land belongs to all of us, not just skiers. As the 1964 Wilderness Act was created to preserve the character of undistributed land for future generations we must make the argument that reclassifying land set aside for those purposes is in the best public interest for everyone, not just the limited few who want to use it for other purposes.

To that end, I would offer the following: These lands are protected by the 1964 Wilderness Act, a law that was created with the stoke of a pen. The only thing preventing it from all disappearing with another stroke of the pen is the ongoing political will to keep it in place. We know there are lobbyists that wield power to see land reclassified as their employers see fit. Therefore, we mustn't take the current state of play for granted. After all, we have all seen recently how seemingly long standing legal precedents can be suddenly overturned by our legal institutions such as the Supreme Court. We must ensure that sufficient political will persists in order to keep these lands preserved. This means instilling a sense of appreciation for these lands in our fellow citizens so they know why they are worth preserving and to keep elected representatives in office that share those same views.

As more people are priced out of winter sports for the aforementioned reasons above, fewer people have the opportunities to experience first hand these lands and why we need to preserve them. Without that, the popular mentality can easily switch to "why should I care if some company wants to log those mountains I never go to?" Sufficient recreational access to our mountains keeps the political will alive to preserve them. If limited development of 0.1% of this land helps to preserve the other 99.9% I'd argue that is a fair tradeoff and in the highest public interest for everyone.

I know that this is a controversial topic and as someone that enjoys spending time in wilderness areas I don't like suggesting it, but after looking at the maps and considering various sites there are unfortunately few other options. I go much more into detail on why this is in [my previous post]({% post_url 2022-05-04-the-politics-of-ski-areas-what-prevents-ski-area-expansion-in-the-pnw %}). It is worth a read to more fully understand why this is the case if you are skeptical of the need.

## Solutions for the future

Alright, so there are some major challenges facing skiing in the PNW. What can we do to address them?

There are four areas of focus that would go a long way to providing sufficient access not just for mechanized skiers, but backcountry skiers, snowshoers, and general snow play (sledding for children and families):

* Expansions of existing ski areas
* Creation of a new ski area to provide competition to the large ski corporations
* Winter maintenance to high elevation trailheads for ski touring, snowshoeing, and sledding
* Increased focus on winter recreation community groups for ongoing advocacy

Keep in mind when reading everything below that these are simply ideas. Some are fairly feasible, others are effectively just exploring the idea. We would not need all of this, at least not all at once. Some of it is pie in the sky level but the exercise in exploring solutions is a useful one regardless.

In my previous post, I summarized the findings of the [1970 North Cascades Winter Sports Study](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Ew06HQTFKXw5MukJIk0gYpbAxpJhgTb/view). 50 years on, I find it's recommendations to still be apt. That is, the Cascades do not have the characteristics for large ski resorts. I know this is a hard pill to swallow, but the snow is too inconsistent, winter weather poor, and high elevation terrain too extreme for the average person, access difficult, and base area locations limited. This is not to say it's impossible, but it does greatly limit options. To that end, the following recommendations and themes pop out:

* For the near future additional ski capacity must come from existing ski areas. The limiting factor here will be parking and available terrain to expand ski capacity into.
* Skiing in Washington will likely always be focused on day-use sites. For the reasons listed above, the Cascades are not suited to large destination ski resorts. Existing ski areas should remain focused on the local market and any potential new ski area should be located near the existing population and be focused on serving it rather than trying to attract out of state visitors.
* Providing convenient backcountry access for snow sports outside of traditional mechanized ski areas has the ability to provide winter recreation opportunities for skiers and non-skiers alike and in an economical fashion.

With that said, let's take a look at specific proposals.

## Ski area expansions

It's no surprise that the easiest and most realistic option is to expand our existing ski areas. Due to wilderness and roadless areas, some of these ski areas have an easier time than others with this.

### Stevens Pass

Arguably the mountain the most badly needs increased capacity is Stevens Pass. Its last major expansion took place in the 1980s with the development of the Mill Valley area (the backside). Since then, Hogsback, Skyline/Barrier, Brooks, and Jupiter have been upgraded to high speed chairlifts but beyond that the overall terrain and notably parking have remained the same (the small lot G was added a few years ago).

Years ago, Stevens published their master plan at the time which showed considerably increased terrain and chairlifts. This proposal was made in 2008 with the forest service but the plan was disputed by The Sierra Club<sup>[9]</sup>. By 2017 (10 years later!), when approval for the additional chairlifts was finally received the Vail acquisition was right around the corner.

![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/stevens_master_plan.jpg)

We don't know what Vail's long term plans for Stevens are. Since the acquisition they have upgraded the Brooks chairlift from a fixed group double to a high-speed quad and replaced the beginner Daisy lift. Welcome changes, but upgrades for two lifts that serve beginner terrain a substantial capacity upgrade does not make. As discussed above, it is doubtful that Vail has any notable expansion plans for Stevens as in their model Stevens acts as a feeder mountain to capture some percentage of the Seattle market, sell them Epic passes, and get them to their destination mountains, mainly Whistler for the Seattle market.

For that reason, I can't say I'm hopeful that anything will come to fruition with Stevens but let's consider what could be done anyway:

* The 2007 master plan still rings true, especially with the additional lifts being given the nod from the forest service.
* The proposed Northern Exposure lift would add desirable intermediate and advanced terrain.
* Kehr's chair should be upgraded to a quad chair (fixed grip or high speed). This would help spread out crowds on the other frontside lifts, Hogsback, Skyline, and Brooks as well as correct the currently odd situation of having a double chair feed into a triple (Double Diamond).
* The proposed Grace Lakes chair would open additional intermediate, advanced, and expert terrain as well.
  * Some of this terrain is already skiable as lift-served backcountry for those whom know where they're going, but having a lift and having it be avalanche controlled in-bounds terrain would open it up to many more people.

As for the parking situation, Stevens is limited by its small base area. There simply is not much level land left for adding additional parking; certainly not enough to keep up with demand. One suggestion I have heard tossed around on the chairlift is putting additional parking in at the bottom of Mill Valley accessible through the Nordic Center. There is already a forest road running the length of the valley and it is cleared for the power lines that run in the valley as well. However, given this narrow valley there is potentially the problem of avalanche danger that would need to be mitigated. Moreover, this is a \~5 mile road to maintain which would be expensive to keep clear. It would also disrupt the trails around the Nordic Center.

A more likely parking scenario would take place in conjunction with a Grace Lakes lift. As anyone that has skied back there will tell you, parts of it are flat, like take off your skis and walk flat. Plus, there is already a snowcat road that goes up there which could be converted to a road for cars with minimal effort. Furthermore, there are some naturally treeless areas which would minimize tree cutting. This would allow for a considerable amount of additional parking near the base area without the need to do difficult, intrusive, and expensive re-grading or the need to maintain a lengthy road in the winter.

### Crystal Mountain

Crystal Mountain is, admittedly, a difficult mountain for me to write about. Partly because they have recently announced major development plans, but also because I don't know if there are many solutions for Crystal to increase its capacity. It is already Washington's largest ski area by a sizeable margin and it's still overcapacity; which gets to the point that we need another ski area in general but more on that further below.

The primary problem with Crystal is lack of parking. This is something Crystal acknowledges 

Before looking at Crystal's current plans let's consider their 2004 master plan:<sup>[11]</sup>

![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/crystal_master_plan.jpg)

This includes some projects that have come to fruition. Namely, lift upgrades, the gondola, and the Northway lift.

However, there was a proposal for chairlifts along the East Peak and Southback areas. These were denied by the forest service due to concerns about affecting dispersed recreation (backcountry skiing) and also purposefully to make it more difficult to access the Norse Peak Wilderness. The 2004 Record of Decision<sup>[11]</sup> states the following:

> My decision eliminates the C-16 (East Peak) chairlift, to address concerns over the potential for skiers to enter into Norse Peak Wilderness.

Even though, it goes on to say that anyone from the ski area would not be permitted to access this land regardless:

> Under the Selected Alternative, the SUP boundary will be closed to ticketed skiers and enforced by Crystal Mountain, which will minimize the likelihood of ticketed skiers from entering into the MRNP or Norse Peak Wilderness.

Which is fairly ridiculous to me as this is public land that is being actively discouraged from use by making it purposefully difficult to access.

The decision also states that there was no need to develop a chairlift in the Southback area because the existing High Campell lift had sufficient capacity:

> With no clear evidence that C-6 (High Campbell), which accesses expert-only terrain, exhibits capacity use, I am not convinced of the need to develop a chairlift in the South Country.

15+ years on, would it be fair to say that times have changed?

Beyond these additional chairlifts that could be added, Crystal appears to be taking its development in a different direction. Its *Reimagine Crystal* project<sup>[12]</sup> significantly upgrades mountain facilities through base area and mountain-top lodge construction and a large hotel, but no new terrain or chairlift upgrades. These are puzzling decisions but I imagine that the hotel stems from the desire to transform Crystal into more of a four season resort to generate summer revenue and offset from future poor snow years. This also helps get more people staying on the property which alleviates a small amount of morning traffic and parking issues. Nevertheless, it is disappointing to see no lift or terrain expansions in these plans.

The biggest capacity issue facing Crystal though is parking. This is demonstrated by how its policy for limiting access has turned to one of managing parking capacity rather than lift capacity.<sup>[13]</sup> Crystal makes no mention of expanding their parking lots in any of their plans. Besides, even if they did, there is a finite capacity to the number of cars that Rt 410 can handle on a given morning. Thus, like some other ski areas with the same problems, they have resorted to using buses to get people to the mountain. Buses are certainly one piece of the puzzle, especially since some people are perfectly happy to not have to drive all the way to the mountain, especially on snowy days that create difficult driving conditions. But I would be interested in exploring one other possible solution: parking garages.

I know, a parking garage in the middle of the Cascades sounds ridiculous and you're likely thinking how addicted can I be to my car to even suggest this? Maybe so, but a parking garage has two attractive properties that warrant consideration:

1. It allows for increased parking capacity without disturbing additional land.
1. Covered parking would not need snow removal and could therefore have a high number of EV charging stations.

If the goal is to reduce transportation-related emissions the biggest goal should be promoting EV use to get to the mountains. Assuming that the power grid connection there can handle it, having a garage full of EV charging stations could significantly help drive adoption if drivers knew their car could charge while they ski instead of having to stop somewhere along the way home (if they didn't have the range already).

The likely problem with this is cost though. It's difficult to pin down even a ballpark number but let's assume it would be in the millions of dollars range for anything substantial. That's a lot of money to throw at parking and it also doesn't solve the problem of road capacity to get to the mountain in the first place. In fact, a garage was studied for use at The Summit at Snoqualmie. However, the forest service decided against it stating:

> To address concerns over limited parking at Summit Central, Summit West, and Alpental, an alternative was develop to provide parking structure in the existing Lot 1 at Summit Central. This alternative was eliminated for two main reasons: economics and visual quality. Primarily, the construction of a parking structure would be prohibitively expensive. If the proponent were to build a parking garage, it would be necessary to recover the cost by charging parking fees. With free parking available elsewhere, ski area guests would have little incentive to use a pay parking area, except for during capacity operations. Such limited use would not provide sufficient economic return to justify the cost of constructing the parking structure.<sup>[14]</sup>

However, given that we're now living in an effectively post-free parking era the economics may make sense now. That said, a garage is not a silver bullet and would only be one part of a multi-pronged approach to more efficiently get people to the mountain while also reducing emissions. More research is needed here.

Another option to alleviate some parking issues would be to maintain winter road access up to Cayuse Pass for use with backcountry skiers. More on backcountry solutions later though.

### Mt. Baker

Mt. Baker is your esteemed author's home mountain. Its fiercely independent attitude, no frills nature, and energetic atmosphere grant it a special place in my heart. Holding the world record for most snowfall in a year certainly helps too. Every winter weekend at Mt. Baker I am reminded of ski areas of the past. The video updates on the snow report, the still mostly reasonable lift ticket prices, the puns on the day tickets, events like the annual golden egg hunt, even the fixed grip chairs continually remind me of what a gem it is. Even the small stuff such as still using full sticker day tickets and spot checking tickets in the lift lines instead of getting RFID scanned every time makes me feel like a valued customer instead of someone who needs to be continually checked for a lift ticket after every single run. The backcountry culture at Baker is bar none as well. I would be devastated if any of this ever changed.

That said, Baker is showing growing pains just like all other ski areas in Western Washington. The increasing population around Bellingham as well as some Seattle skiers trying to escape the crowds are putting pressure on Baker. As a result, they have begun capping the number of season pass sales. On big days it's also possible for the mountain to run out of parking (reportedly they are working on expanding parking slightly which will definitely help with these growing pains<sup>[15]</sup> ).

Most problematically though is that Baker is nearly landlocked by wilderness areas. Assuming they wanted to expand their terrain, which is a big if since as far as I know Baker has no desire to become a large ski area, they have few options for doing so.

Another issue that Baker has to contend with is that it is not connected to the power grid. As a result, all of its chairlifts, except for chair 7, are powered by diesel engines. To Baker's credit, this summer they are upgrading chairs 4, 5, and 6 to electric engines.<sup>[15]</sup> These chairs are then powered by a generator which, while still burning gas, I'd assume is more efficient. At some point in the future, I'd hope that Baker will become connected to the power grid so this power source could be swapped out for a renewable source. I could see this becoming a liability for Baker under Washington's cap-and-trade emissions reduction program as part of the Washington Climate Commitment Act.<sup>[16]</sup>

Out of all of the mountains I researched for this blog post, Mt. Baker is the most difficult to get any info on. The usual suspects of EISs, master plans, records of decision from the forest service, etc. have turned up nothing. I can't even find a map of their actual permit boundary; short of a FOIA request I'm not sure I will ever find it either. So while I can make some suggestions based on my own opinions, when it comes to Baker I'm mostly flying blind with regards to what the owners may or may not have up their sleeves already and what was considered in the past. If you do have any information or documentation about Baker's development, future or historical, I would love to talk with you! See the header for my email.

So, what could Baker do? Well, if wilderness areas are not adjusted, not much unfortunately aside from upgrading lifts to be higher capacity/detachable. Consider the map of the wilderness/roadless areas (in grey) that surround Baker's rough ski area boundary (since I don't have a map of their actual permit area):

![](/assets/images/ski_area_study/mt_baker_boundary.jpg)

As I touched on in my previous post, it's not clear how the 2001 roadless rule affects existing ski area expansions into roadless areas. Assuming that were allowed, Baker does have some limited options for expansions while staying outside of the wilderness areas:

* A chairlift up the eastern side of Mt. Herman
  * Anything in the Bagley Lakes area would need to be combine with a way to get back out and up to the base area as well. This could be a rope toe or T-bar.
  * This area could be problematic for construction though since as the name implies, there's a handful of lakes here.
* A chairlift towards Artist Point or the eastern side of Table Mountain
  * Anecdotally, I've had conversations with people who claimed these were in the plans for Baker at some point in the past but I've never found any documents supporting that.
* A chairlift to the top of Hemispheres either from the top of chair 8 or from gunners ridge off of chair 1
  * This area could be problematic to avalanche control, however.
* A chairlift down into Swift Creek
  * This would be going into lower elevation terrain which would be marginal skiing at times though.

All of this comes at the cost of displacing terrain that is currently heavily used for backcountry skiing and snowshoeing in the case of Artist Point. As someone that skis these areas regularly myself, this not a proposal I make lightly. Us ski tourers must recognize though that for the larger good of our sport, the ski areas must expand outward from where they are to increase their capacity. This isn't all bad though, for those of us with passes at Baker a chairlift towards Herman or Artist Point means quicker access to the terrain beyond those areas. For those without a pass, Baker could offer a backcountry specific ticket good for limited use only to get to the backcountry terrain similar to what Whistler does.<sup>[17]</sup> Any conversion of currently easily accessible backcountry terrain should be replaced with similar terrain access elsewhere though. More on this in the backcountry section below.

### Alpental

Similar to Mt. Baker, Alpental is fairly boxed in by wilderness areas preventing any major expansions. From their 2005 master plan we can see it covers what is essentially the current ski area + the back bowls in addition to a small amount of terrain on the other side of the valley.

![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/alpental_boundary.jpg)

This stands in contrast to the original plans for Alpental when it was founded to build a tramway on the east side of the valley to Cave Ridge and then a chairlift to the summit of Snoqualmie Mountain.<sup>[18]</sup> This would have essentially doubled the size of Alpental from what it is today and bring it's top elevation nearly 1,000ft higher to \~6,200ft. This also could have served as a base for future expansions on the other side of Snoqualmie Mountain onto north facing terrain. Alas, these plans died in 1976 when Snoqualmie Mountain was included in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.

The 2005 master plan also called for a pulse gondola to be installed from the base area to the summit along with a small summit lodge that would operate year round serving as a restaurant, sightseeing, and recreation location. Note that a pulse gondola is different from a detachable gondola in that it has limited, fixed grip cabins which travel in a pack as shown in the illustration below.

![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/alpental_gondola.jpg)

These plans were dropped, however, per the forest service's rationale:

> In order to address concerns over low freezing levels, two alternatives were developed to increase access to and round-trip skiing on the high elevation terrain at Alpental. The first alternative considered a revised location of the proposed Pulse Gondola to create a mid-station at the bottom of Upper Internationale. In the MDP, the primary purpose of the gondola would be to address summer recreation and access to the mountain-top restaurant for all users. In this capacity, the gondola would provide little round-trip skiing, particularly for skiers below the expert ability level. In order to address round-trip skiing, the gondola would have to be upgraded to a higher capacity lift. This alternative was eliminated from further consideration because the proposed Internationale lift already addresses the need with less cost compared to a high-speed gondola.<sup>[14]</sup>

Which, in all fairness, does make sense. A pulse gondola, while great for summer access, would do little to handle heavy skier traffic. With Armstrong Express having been built, the proposed gondola would not have served little winter purpose. Although I could see a mountaintop restaurant accessible via gondola so close to Seattle being a popular destination on nice summer evenings.

As a small digression, in response to the 2005 proposal the Sierra Club (of course) argued for actually shrinking the size of the ski area and preventing future lift infrastructure with the following proposals:<sup>[14]</sup>

* The lift system at Alpental would not expand to the west of the existing infrastructure.
* Reduction of the permit boundary on the west end of Alpental.
* Reduction in the permit boundary east of Mt. Hyak, resulting in elimination of approximately 150 acres of permit area.
* Redesignation of the permit area on the east slope of Mt. Hyak and northeast slope of Mt. Catherine.

For an organization that states on [their website's home page](https://www.sierraclub.org/) "We believe in getting people outside to enjoy the outdoors" they sure have a funny way of going about it. Anyway&hellip;

The most notable item to discuss about Alpental is the [Summit 2030 plans](https://summitatsnoqualmie.com/summit-2030). This involves three notable projects:<sup>[19]</sup>

* Building the proposed International triple chair as roughly shown in 2005 plans above.
* Upgrading and re-aligning Sessel for access to the new International chair and for better access to intermediate terrain.
* Upgrading Edelweiss to a triple chair

All of this will significantly increase uphill capacity which I think we all can applaud. Looking beyond these projects though, is there anywhere Alpental could expand into new terrain? Well, not really without considering wilderness areas. It could add more chairlifts into its current back bowls which are already in its permit boundary. Beyond that, there is a small window on the other side of the valley that is not a wilderness area while still wide enough for a lift. Really though, the best and highest terrain would likely be the original plans from the 1960s with a chairlift to the top of Snoqualmie Mountain. Just one chairlift there would open a considerable amount of high elevation terrain. In fact, it may be the only way to save skiing in Snoqualmie Pass.

What about the other side of the highway? Where is Summit East, West, &amp; Central in all of this? The Summit 2030 plans have improvements for Summit too. However, the long term climate trends for skiing in Snoqualmie is not looking good. In [my post on the Cascade snowpack]({% post_url 2022-04-12-when-is-the-end-of-the-golden-age-of-pnw-skiing %}) I noted that unlike other ski areas in the Cascades, Snoqualmie is starting to see decreased snowpack year over year. With this trend certain to continue for the foreseeable future, the days of skiing at Summit may be numbered. The base elevation of Snoqualmie Pass at 3,000ft is simply too low to avoid the coming effects of climate change, even with its access to the cold eastern Washington air coming up the pass. Alpental may be spared with its higher elevation, but all it takes is a few bad snow years to make a ski area uneconomical and fold entirely. Snoqualmie in particular is problematic for this as well due to how much of the Seattle market is served by its terrain. For skiing to continue in Snoqualmie pass in the coming decades it may likely be necessary to reclassify some of the higher elevation terrain currently in wilderness areas to replace the lower elevation terrain that will become nonviable for a commercial ski area.

### Mission Ridge

Mission Ridge is currently attempting to undergo a significant expansion. Namely, they are building the following:<sup>[20]</sup>

* Expanded beginner terrain &amp; new chairlifts to service this terrain
* Additional day-use parking
* A snow tubing area and nordic trails
* A small village area with restaurants and shops
* Condos, townhomes, and single family homes

![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/mission_ridge_expansion.jpg)

Mission Ridge is unique in that it currently sits on the edge of national forest land. Thus, in 2014 the owner of Mission Ridge bought \~800 acres of adjacent land that is privately owned. This is what allows them to build out such a significant base area. Earlier in this post I expressed my distaste of development like this in our mountains but that the is advantage of privately owned land: you can do (mostly) what you want with it.

Despite this, the Mission Ridge expansion faces permitting issues with this project. When the project was proposed in 2015 they believed construction could begin circa 2017. Now, seven years, $1 million, and a lawsuit later and it's still mired in legal battles and red tape.<sup>[21]</sup> We can only hope that the legal costs don't become high enough to kill the project as [tends to happen in Washington.](https://snowbrains.com/early-winters-resort-wa-a-ski-hill-that-never-was/)

### White Pass

White Pass is a difficult ski area for me to write about. Mainly because it is the furthest ski area from me and thus I know the least about it. I know little of its present day challenges. The only plans I know about are [to expand its lodges](https://unofficialnetworks.com/2021/10/04/white-pass-expansion-proposal/). As for parking, White Pass is blessed with a good amount of fairly flat land at its base that could be used to expand parking in the future if necessary.

Would it be possible to expand its terrain if desired in the future? Sort of. Similar to Mt. Baker and Alpental, White Pass is nearly boxed in by wilderness areas. From their 1990 expansion plans though, there was a proposal to put another lift in below the current Couloir Express.

![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/white_pass_1990_proposal.png)

I don't know why this "chairlift 7" was not built, whether it was a permitting issue, funding issue, or just the capacity has not been needed yet. More info is needed here, but in theory it could be a viable option for future terrain expansion at White Pass.

## New ski area development

Now for the fun part: Let's say we wanted to build a new ski area, where would it go and how would it operate?

**To be clear, this is mostly a thought exercise.** I am not naive enough to think that we'll have a new ski area in the Cascades any time soon or ever really. Do we need a new ski area? Yes. Should we build a new ski area? Yes. Will we have a new ski area? No. The defeatist attitude around any development proposal is disappointing. Instead of the response being "how can we make this happen?" it's instead "that won't happen" and is dismissed. We've lost the ability to build things in this country. But this won't stop me from writing about what could be given the motivation to bring it to fruition.

First though, why do we need a new ski area? A few reasons:

1. Climate change is going to negatively affect our existing ski areas. Snoqualmie in particular serves a great deal of the Seattle market and in a few short decades may be not viable as a commercial ski area location anymore. That capacity will need to be replaced elsewhere should be strive not to price out even larger swaths of the population from the sport.
1. Our existing ski areas have limited expansion potential. Parking in particular is a major issue and beyond that the two lane roads leading to them have a finite capacity as well.
1. The population of Washington will continue to grow rapidly in the coming decades. We are already far behind the eight ball when it comes to keeping up ski area capacity with population growth. This trend continuing over the coming decades will force ski areas to turn away more customers as they struggle to deal with such demand increases.
1. In order to keep skiing (relatively) affordable and accessible the consolidation trends in the market need to be countered by creating competition. This means new ski areas independent from the major ski corporations.

### Desired Characteristics

With that in mind, we can outline the desired characteristics of a new ski area in the Cascades:

* The location would ideally be on the west side of the Cascades. This is for proximity to the Puget Sound population center and to reduce carbon emissions from needing to drive less miles and to stay within round-trip EV range.
  * Being on the west side also reduces summer wildfire risk.
* The base area must be above 4,000ft at least in order to future-proof it from climate change.
  * Ideally a base area above 5,000ft would be best. Snowmaking can compensate somewhat if lower but this is expensive and resource intensive and should be avoided if possible.
* It should have at least 1,500 - 2,000ft of vertical rise for skiing.
* As high of a summit elevation as possible is better, but it's worth mentioning that being above treeline can be extremely difficult to ski in when visibility drops.
* It must be close to existing roads to avoid disturbing remote areas with new road construction and to keep costs down.
  * Road access also needs to consider avalanche risk. Performing avalanche mitigation is costly.
  * The traffic of existing road corridors should be considered as well. For example, anything along US-2 is going to suffer severe traffic problems until the highway is widened or towns bypassed.
* It should have a mix of beginner, intermediate, and advanced terrain. We don't want mellow green runs everywhere but we also don't want only cliff bands.
* A north facing aspect is generally preferred for ski area to avoid winter time southern sun exposure.
* A relatively flat area for a base area and parking is required.
* Easy access to the power grid is necessary for powering chairlifts instead of resorting to diesel engines/generators.
* Ideally not in a wilderness area. This would make it much, much easier since otherwise it would require an act of Congress to declassify wilderness land.
  * For the sake of exploring options I do include some locations in wilderness areas here. Unfortunately, there are nearly no viable options in the western Cascades otherwise.
  * Roadless areas would be nice to avoid as well, but there are literally potential zero locations to consider if looking outside roadless areas. Moreover, it's still unclear if the current roadless areas permit ski area development or not. Hence I consider roadless areas fair game because otherwise the answer to all of this is "no new ski area ever."

### Limiting Environmental Impact

TODO: include 1960s seattle times article here about destroying wilderness?

Any new development is going to raise environmental concerns. There are steps we can take to minimize these:

* Avoid sensitive areas entirely. There are some areas of the Cascades that are exceptionally beautiful that absolutely no one wants to see developed. For example, Washington Pass, Cascade Pass, Alpine Lakes Wilderness, the Enchantments, and many more. While some of these areas meet many of the desired characteristics outlined above I have not considered them due to the horror of even considering to develop them.
* Tree loss should be minimized. While it is unavoidable to remove some trees for parking lots, chairlifts, and base area infrastructure it can be minimized. For example:
  * Utilize naturally tree-less areas as much as possible (scree fields and meadows)
  * Prefer thinning trees vs. clear cutting
  * For ski runs that do need to be cut prefer them as narrow as practical. It may also be possible to put them near the edges of the ski area to double as fire breaks for wildfire protection in the summer.
  * Disallow cutting of old growth trees over, say, 80-100 years old. These trees are important habitats and fare much better in wildfires than new growth trees.
  * As discussed previously, it may be possible to build a parking garage to minimize the footprint needed for parking lots. Or at least start with a parking lot and build up rather than out as necessary over the years.
* Only electric chairlifts should be used.
* The ski area should be high enough elevation that ideally no snow making is required. This saves money and resources on water and electricity for producing artificial snow as well as land for building reservoirs to draw water from.
* Limit base area development to the bare minimum. This would means a small lodge for lessons, rentals, tickets, ski patrol, restrooms, lunch, and warming. Plus a maintenance and operations facility and some employee housing.
* Consider the use of [hydrogen powered snowcats](https://insideevs.com/news/461835/prinoth-electric-hydrogen-snow-groomers/).
  * Snowcats/groomers are potentially a good application for hydrogen in that they operate in a fixed location so one refueling station is all that is needed and having a more limited range is okay since a quick trip down the mountain to re-fuel is not a big deal. It would, however, require a source of renewable hydrogen since most hydrogen production currently comes from fossil fuels.
  * There are also some electric options too. Either hydrogen or electric still has some ways to go before ready for commercial use but it's reasonable to assume that the timeline it would take build a new ski area in the Cascades would match up with the commercial availability of these types of snow groomers.
* Electric snowmobiles should be used by ski patrol and operations. The limited range is not a concern when operating in a fixed area and can be charged when not in use during the day.
* Support EV charging in parking lots.
  * This may be difficult to support on a large scale in conjunction with snow removal, but that is not an insurmountable issue.
* If possible, consider having the parking lots or entire base area be separate from the ski area. For example, consider Silver Mountain Idaho where the parking lot is in town and the longest gondola in the US transports skiers up the mountain to the ski area. This is highly location dependent but could offer a model that avoids most land disturbance.
* Construction of new chairlifts could be done in the spring when sufficient snowpack does not require the building of roads to access construction sites. For example, how the [Coulior Express at White Pass was built](https://liftblog.com/2015/07/06/lift-profile-couloir-express-at-white-pass-wa/).

If all of these items are enacted it would limit the environmental of the initial development plus reduce the carbon emissions of operation of the ski area to only cars driving up. Which, in time, will hopefully become electric as well. Washington has an opportunity through new development to set an example for how to decarbonize a currently carbon intensive industry.

### Mapping the Cascades

Based on the desired characteristics listed above, we can narrow our search to a few general locations. First, we want to consider locations on the western side of the Cascades or near the passes. The Stampede Gap area, from near I-90 to just north of Crystal Mountain is a notably low elevation section of the Cascades and not suitable for ski areas. South of Rainier/White Pass is starting get closer to Portland than Seattle. Thus, my primary area of focus is the area north of Stevens Pass and into the North Cascades. This is due to its higher elevations, existing road access, and being undeveloped for skiing aside from Mt. Baker. Admittedly, it also the part of the Cascades I know the best and spend most of my time in so there is some bias here. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of possible locations. Certainly other locations exist and I encourage anyone with suggestions to share them with me please!

In order to make it quicker to identify and assess location candidates I created a map that shades the Cascades by our elevations of interest. It also has layers for National Forests, wilderness areas, and roadless areas. There is also a forest roads layer to assess if a location has a developed road leading it already. Moreover, to get a sense of the quality of skiing at the location a slope angle layer is included. 

This map was created from USGS DEM data<sup>[22]</sup> for the Cascades, imported into [QGIS](https://qgis.org/), converted to hillshade &amp; slope angle perspectives, colored by elevation band, and then exported to raster tiles for display as a web map. Note that the lighting here is coming from the north which is unnatural, especially in the winter, but provides the most "normal" looking map. I also created a layer with the light coming from the south to get a sense of which aspects would be shaded in the winter but I found it made little difference when looking for locations so it has been omitted here to save on bandwidth.

The elevation colors correspond to the following:

* Brown: < 3,500ft (nonviable today)
* Red: 3,500ft - 4,000ft (likely nonviable in the future)
* Orange: 4,000ft - 5,000ft (acceptable)
* Green: 5,000ft - 6,000ft (good)
* Blue: > 6,000ft (ideal)

It is worth noting that these elevation bands are a generalization. The warmer air on the western Cascades necessitates higher elevations than the colder air on the eastern Cascades. They also don't account for local weather effects such as cold, eastern WA air making its way up Snoqualmie Pass. As the focus is on skiing in the western Cascades appropriate elevations were chosen for that region.

For the slope angles, the colors correspond to:

* Brown: 0-5&deg;
* Green: 5-15&deg;
* Blue: 15-25&deg;
* Orange: 25-55&deg;
* Red: >55&deg;

These correspond with slope trail ratings (beginner, intermediate, advanced/expert). Anything over 55&deg; is considered unskiable.

So, here's the map with the areas I've given consideration to:

<div class="map-toggle-group">
  <div class="map-toggle" data-layer="highways">Highways</div>
  <div class="map-toggle" data-layer="forest_roads">Forest Roads</div>

### Potential Locations

#### Mt. Baker

*Note: Mt. Baker here refers to the actual Mt. Baker rather than the ski area.*

One of the environmental considerations outlined above was to avoid sensitive and unique areas in particular. Given that Washington has thousands of named mountains but only five volcanoes it is reasonable to treat our volcanoes as unique and special areas. Thus, Mt. Baker is assessed here with hesitation and for one reason only: our current laws ironically make it easier to use Mt. Baker for recreational purposes than many fairly generic areas of the Cascades. It is not without precedent to consider a volcano for skiing though; consider Mt. Hood and Mt. Bachelor in Oregon, for example.

The Washington State Wilderness Act of 1984 created a tremendous amount of wilderness areas in the Cascades, including on and around Mt. Baker. Except for one particular carve out: the Mt. Baker National Recreation Area. This area (pictured below) is a wedge shape extending nearly to the summit of Mt. Baker along its south face. The act explicitly allows for snowmobile use in this area in addition to other recreational uses as such:

> The Secretary shall administer the recreation area in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the national forests in such manner as will best provide for (1) public outdoor recreation (including but not limited to snowmobile use); (2) conservation of scenic, natural, historic, and other values contributing to public enjoyment; and (3) such management, utilization, and disposal of natural resources on federally owned lands within the recreation area which are compatible with and which do not significantly impair the purposes for which the recreation area is established.

So while nearly all of the high elevation terrain in the western side of the Cascades is designated as wilderness, a decent amount of Mt. Baker is not and is specifically "zoned" per se for recreational use. In terms of what it politically possible, the best chance for a high elevation ski area in western Washington would need to be outside of a wilderness area and the Mt. Baker NRA is just that. As much I would prefer to not develop one of our precious few volcanoes, this is what the laws have left the door open to.

With that in mind, let's look at some of its other characteristics:

* Good road access exists to the Easton Glacier parking lot. Some of this road is already maintained in the winter for access to the sno-park. It would need to be widened and paved, however.
* It's base elevation would live around the 4,000ft and the summit is limited by the edge of the Easton Glacier around 6,000ft.
* The base area would be a mere 7 miles from Upper Baker Dam allowing for easy electrical connections to power chairlifts.
* Its location on the edge of the Cascades makes for a \~2 hour drive from downtown Seattle. Plus, most of that is I-5 and Rt 20 so (on weekends) traffic would be considerably less than roads such as Stevens Pass.
* If necessary, Baker Lake provides for an ample reservoir for snowmaking. This water being less needed in the winter than in the summer.
* It's proximity to the town of Concrete would spur economic development there. It also allows for ample land relatively close to the ski area for development of housing.
* If needed, Schriebers Meadow provides a great deal of fairly flat land for base area development and/or parking. It's close proximity to what would be the ski lifts would allow for a remote parking situation where a tram or gondola could transport skiers up to the mountain requiring less cutting of trees and grading to make parking lots higher up the mountain.
* The lifts could also see use in the summer for those wishing to hike in the area, summit Mt. Baker, or ski tour on the glacier in the summer.

It's worth noting as well that this would displace or partially displace snowmobilers that currently use this land for that purpose. Displacing someone from their present activities is not something to be taken lightly. Thus it should be determined if skiing and snowmobiling can coexist at this location. If not, a suitable replacement location should be established. It is easier to find land for snowmobiling than it is for a ski area.

To help visualize these potential locations, I took advantage of a clear day to take aerial photos of some of them. These photos were all taken on April 24th, 2022. To get an idea of the snow levels, this is something of a springtime snowpack. April 2022 was exceptionally snowy and thus the snowpack this month more closely represented normal March snowpack than late April.

#### Cutthroat Pass

Cutthroat Pass is one of the locations studied in the [*North Cascades Winter Sports Study*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Ew06HQTFKXw5MukJIk0gYpbAxpJhgTb/view). Located near Washington Pass along the North Cascades Highway, it's most attractive quality is that it provides a huge amount of high elevation terrain, even for its would-be base area. Additionally, it is not located within a wilderness area and it has excellent road access by merit of being along the North Cascades Highway.

![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/cutthroat_pass_map.png)

The downsides to it being that 1. it's fairly far from Seattle at over three hours. This would mean it's primary demographic would be Whatcom, Skagit, and Snohomish county residents. That still represents a good (and ever growing) amount of people, certainly enough to support a small ski area. It's remote location means electricity would be a problem as well.

But the biggest issue is that the North Cascades Highway is closed during the winter due to avalanche danger. The question for this location and any others along Rt 20 becomes is it possible to keep the North Cascades Highway open during the winter? Possibly! At least to Rainy Pass. We need a small history lesson to understand why this may be though.

When the road was being built in the 1960s the state did not plan to initially maintain winter access but rather wait until usage and traffic deemed it necessary to undergo the expensive process of maintaining winter access, ideally without the need for any snowsheds.<sup>[23]</sup> In the early 1970s WSDOT hired Ed LaChapelle, one of the pioneers of the field of avalanche forecasting, to conduct a study of avalanche activity along the North Cascades Highway. The state found it so useful that they hired LaChapelle to conduct similar studies elsewhere in Washington. In the years that followed, his team went on to conduct these studies and install remote weather stations in the passes and ski areas and develop a systemic method for avalanche hazard forecasting. In 1979 three members of the team, Mark Moore, Rich Mariott, and Roland Emetaz became the founding members of [NWAC](https://nwac.us).<sup>[24]</sup>

The study that LaChapelle completed resulted in two publications: [*Avalanches on the North Cascades Highway*](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/north_cascades_highway_avalanche_report.pdf) and [*North Cascades Highway SR-20 Avalanche Atlas*](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/north_cascades_highway_avalanche_atlas.pdf). The former outlines his findings and recommendations. In the study, LaChapelle noted that the most dangerous section of the road are the Washington Pass and Cutthroat Ridge (as opposed to Cutthroat Pass) areas. He noted it may be possible to keep the road open during the winter but with regular closures anywhere from 10-40% of the time depending on risk tolerance, avalanche danger, and amount of artillery-based avalanche control conducted. Another option would be to maintain the lower elevation sections only such that less time would be needed to clear the high elevation sections in the spring. He also considered the possibility of snowsheds or other defensive structures. It was noted that these could certainly help with keeping the road open more often but their cost and effect on the scenery of the area made them unlikely options to move forward with. Ultimately, the state used LaChapelle's findings to argue for the road to be closed entirely during the winter.<sup>[25]</sup>

<sup>Credit: WSDOT</sup>

What does this mean for a location like Cutthroat Pass? Well, the good news is that it's west of the primary areas of concern: Washington Pass &amp; Cutthroat Ridge and it would seemingly be reasonable to keep the road open to this location given a similar avalanche control control on the order of magnitude as Stevens Pass. However, this would be extremely expensive. The *North Cascades Winter Sports Study* estimated it would cost $650k/yr to keep the whole road open.<sup>[23]</sup> Adjusted for inflation that's $4.9M/yr. Compare that to the $200-250k/yr spent to clear the road each spring.<sup>[26]</sup> That's a tough sell for a road that would only access a small ski area. Only Rt. 542 to Mt. Baker is kept open in the winter for purely recreational purposes. All other passes in Washington are for connecting the east and west of the state throughout the winter.

Ultimately, the Rainy Pass area of the North Cascades likely has some of the most ideal terrain for a ski area in Washington: abundant high elevation terrain with excellent road access that is not in a wilderness area. However, its remote location puts it borderline too far from the western Washington population and uneconomical for maintaining winter access to.

#### Snowking Mountain

Snowking Mountain may be my favorite potential location. The elephant in its room is that it is located entirely within a wilderness area so we need to put that aside when considering it's other qualities.

Snowking is located just south of Marblemount and is accessible from multiple sides. Either from east on the Cascade River Road side or from the west where Illabot Creek Road comes within 2-3 miles of the base of the mountain. The mountain itself has a summit of 7,433ft and a myriad of bowls of various aspects. Electricity connections may be a problem, but the nearest power lines appear to be roughly 10 miles away so it's not nearly as remote as other potential locations.

Additionally, it's proximity to Marblemount means it is roughly a 1.75hr drive from Seattle. It could also provide a healthy amount of economic development for Marblemount and make it into something of a ski town in the winter. As the North Cascades Hwy is closed during the winter it would also mean minimal traffic for getting to/from the ski area on the underutilized winter-time roads there.

Snowking-Found Creek was one of the locations studied in the *North Cascades Winter Sports Study* (NCWSS) which came to the conclusion to eliminate it as an option. So why is it one of my favorite locations? Because the NCWSS considered one specific part of Snowking only. Also in 1970, prior to the 1984 WA State Wilderness Act they have vastly more land to consider as potential locations. They also weren't specifically looking for a location close to the Seattle population center. When you consider that today we have far fewer options due to litigation between then and now some of these previously eliminated options can begin to look attractive again.

The Snowking-Found Creek may be a poor location (and it certainly does from looking at aerial photos) but other parts of Snowking look entirely reasonable; it's huge area after all. When you combine it with Mt. Chaval or Mt. Buckindy next door, there's even more options. In fact, it's hard for me to pin down one specific location in this general area because there are a myriad of possible options. None perfect mind you, but many promising.

If some wilderness land were to be re-classified to allow for development, Snowking would prove a good candidate for that in that it is located on the edge of a wilderness area. Thus, development of it would not mean cutting deep into wilderness land but rather developing land that is currently on the edge of it.

#### Hidden Lake

On the other side of the valley from Snowking Mountain sits Hidden Lake Peak. Admittedly, Hidden Lake is something of a long shot. But it's currently a popular backcountry ski location and not in a wilderness area so I wanted to cover it briefly.

Hidden Lake is interesting in that it's fairly high elevation (7,000ft), located off of Cascade River Road, and not in a wilderness area. The North Cascades National Park starts on the other side of the ridge but the west side of Hidden Lake Peak is all National Forest land.

![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/hidden_lake_peak_aerial.jpg)

The primary benefit to Hidden Lake is its location. Located outside of Marblemount it's easily accessible, Cascade River Road is paved most of the way there, and it would not be too much trouble to run electricity a few more miles up the road.

The primary problem with Hidden Lake, however, is lack of available land for a base area. There only reasonably flat land is along Cascade River Road. This would necessitate some type of transfer system to get skiers up to the snow level. The secondary problem is that the size of the mountain simply isn't that large. Assuming the land outside of the park is only on the table, then it's really just the west face of the mountain which could be served entirely by a single chairlift.

It's for those reasons that Hidden Lake does not have the terrain characteristics for really even a small ski area.

&hellip;however, it does have potential as a sort of limited access ski area similar to [Silverton Mountain, Colorado](https://silvertonmountain.com/). Silverton operates an ultra-minimalist ski area with a single chairlift and a base area comprised of a yurt and small parking lot. For most of the winter it is open to guided trips only with typically fewer than 80 skiers on the mountain. Some avalanche mitigation is done but all skiers are required to have an avalanche kit with them to be on the mountain. Something similar could work at Hidden Lake, especially if the lift was used to access the ridge and then those wishing to ski tour in the park would have easy access to the high elevation terrain and excellent winter skiing there.

#### White Chuck Mountain

White Chuck Mountain is something of an unconventional option and a long shot in general. It's not especially large but it is not located in a wilderness area, is close to the town of Darrington, and has road access to a would-be base area. While its summit is just shy of 7,000ft, what could be the ski area would sit more between 4,500ft and 6,000ft. Not necessarily ideal, but still workable.

In addition to road access, it has a good amount of flat land for a base area and parking. And similar to Marblemount, the proximity to Darrington could spur economic development there while providing nearby land for housing.

![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/white_chuck_aerial.jpg)

#### Sloan &amp Bedal Peaks

Sloan Peak and Bedal Peak are similar to White Chuck Mountain in that they're not particularly ideal locations but they do have a fairly highly summit of nearly 8,000ft, have existing road access, and are located near Darrington. If Mountain Loop Highway were paved and maintained in the winter, this area could be 1.5-2 hours from Seattle. It is, however, in a wilderness area.

The terrain here can possibly work nicely as Sloan and Bedal Peaks are connected by a high elevation saddle which could make for good mix of ski area terrain.

![](/assets/images/ski_area_vision/sloan_bedal_peaks_aerial.jpg)

#### Mt. Howard, Mt. Mastiff, and Rock Mountain

A bit down the road from the Stevens Pass Nordic Center sits Mt. However, Mt. Mastiff, and Rock Mountain. These three mountains are all fairly high elevation, at around 7,000ft. They also have the benefit of sitting next to US-2 thus providing existing winter maintained road access and easy electricity access. Moreover, they are not in a wilderness area.

The downside here is that the elevation at the road is well below the typical snow level at \~2,700ft. While all this flat land would be great for parking and a base area, it would mean that a gondola would be needed to get skiers up to the mountain and back down again at the end of the day. That's certainly do-able and could be seen as a benefit as it limits impact to the higher elevation environments. As with all gondolas though, it is extremely expensive and likely outside the realm of possibility for a small ski area.

Plus, being another 15 minutes down the road from Stevens would add another 30 minutes round trip which is starting to be a stretch when combined with the existing travel times due to traffic on US-2 in the afternoons.

#### Yodelin

Finally, at the start of this post I included some information on lost ski areas in the Cascades, particularly Yodelin. While Yodelin's terrain is not all that exciting and it has the problem of being right next door to Stevens Pass meaning the parking woes would continue, it does have some positive characteristics:

* It is a former ski area and it is far easier to re-open a closed ski area than to develop a brand new site.
* Runs were previously cut so any re-clearing would be only new growth trees. In fact, from satellite photos most of this land has been logged previously.
* It is not in a wilderness or a roadless area.
* In terms of providing competition to Stevens and giving skiers a choice of where to ski, having another option right next door couldn't be better.
* It closed primarily due to competition with the larger Stevens Pass. Given how overcapacity Stevens presently is, it would hard to imagine a ski area less than five minutes further down the road being underutilized.

On the other hand, having a ski area right beside one of Vail's properties would likely be fought tooth and nail by the corporation. It also adds even more traffic to US-2. Plus, given that Stevens currently uses the old Yodelin parking lot as an overflow lot I'd assume they have some type of right to use that land. Any base area for a new Yodelin would likely need to build a new parking lot and base area.

### Economics

Assuming that a suitable location was found, there is the all important issue of funding initial development and how such a ski area would operate. It may seem like an exceptionally daunting task to start a ski area, and it should be as it's no small undertaking. However, consider that many, if not most, ski areas have humble beginners. They were usually no more than a small group of people that started with a single chairlift and grew from there as the sport grew. Let's consider a few examples from Washington in particular:

The history of Crystal Mountain is deep and rich but to summarize it here, shortly after World War II and with the demise of the tow rope at Paradise, interest grew for a ski area outside of Mt. Rainier National Park. A small group of local skiers and businessmen spent a few years searching for the right location before landing on the Silver Creek area. In 1958, the then formed Crystal Mountain, Inc. issued a stock offering to raise the funds needed for the initial development of the site. Investors were given an annual dividend of one lift ticket per share having bought at least 20 shares at $50/share; roughly equal to $10,000 in total today. 800 investors took up the offer. In 1962 Crystal Mountain opened with two chairlifts and a third, Green Valley, built the following year.<sup>[27]</sup> When Crystal Mountain, Inc. was sold to Boyne Resorts in 1997 the shareholders converted their holdings into membership units in the [Crystal Mountain Founders Club](https://crystalfoundersclub.com/index.html) which continues to operate today.

A similar story played out for the founding of Mission Ridge. todo: finish this.

What we can learn from this is that there is a history of selling stock in the corporation behind the ski area in order to raise money to fund its initial development. Assuming the 800 investors of Crystal bought the minimum $10,000 that would be $8M in startup money. These days I can only imagine that interest would be far greater. Plus, when considering these shares came with lift tickets, a $10,000 investment could be seen as a bargain considering what season passes cost at most ski areas these days.

This is not to say that a new ski area should adopt all of the practices of the past. The creation of another for-profit ski area operating on national forest land would not serve the interests of the public at large. If an entity is to be formed to operate the ski area it should be created as a non-profit and/or co-op. The non-profit would help ensure that prices remain reasonable and accessible while the co-op would ensure the best interests of local skiers are kept front and center.

There are some examples we can look to to see how this would work. Bridger bowl and skeethawk

Lastly, while there is certainly enough demand for another ski area it is worth considering how a smaller ski area, potentially located further away from Seattle than existing areas would attract skiers. Aside from being a locally focused, more affordable ski area, and hopefully less crowded ski area, a good example to consider is the battle between Whistler and Blackcomb in the 1980s.

* locally focused
* skeetawk model with sponsorship levels

* Competition
  * Whistler vs. Blackcomb
    * Wiping windshields
    * Coffee/hot chocolate in the lift lines
    * Helicopter parking

## Backcountry Access

As a passionate backcountry skier, it would be amiss to not touch on backcountry access concerns as well.

* quick fix
  * voltuneering plowing, montana example
* Need for more winter access and/or backcountry huts
* possible locations:
  * skyline divide
  * north cascades hwy
  * mtn loop
  * pilchuck
  * cayuse pass http://www.alpenglow.org/skiing/cayuse-2001/index.html
  * paradise

Let's take a look at the current state of play then. What are the characteristics of our existing ski areas. After all, they work for skiing so matching similar terrain would be a good starting point for success.

Snoqualime: This one looks different from the others. I can hear you saying "what gives? According to your map Snoqualimie Pass is already not a viable ski area yet it operates each year. This map must be wrong." ...local weather factors can dominate in an area. we're just going off of elevation here which is a good starting point, but not the whole story.
