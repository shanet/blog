1. the testing framework sucks (super slow and modules have 3x lines of test than code)
2. config issues
3. module naming schemes (massive prefixes)
4. lack of flexibility (more surgical coding)
5. PHP
6. dev environments
7. when something goes wrong, it's impossible to determine the problem
8. db migrations suck
